### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Create equal height columns for your content using flexbox CSS. See an examples here:

- Looks like the contact form isn't working on ASO - but this could just be an issue with Composer install on their servers. Not held against you - but let's see if we can help you fix this.
- Your URLs will appear a little cleaner in you direct your nav links to the appropriate sudirectory only, and leave off the "index.php" references.
- Maybe just some space between the social media icons in the footer?
